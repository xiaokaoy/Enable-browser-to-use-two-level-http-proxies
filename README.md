# two-level-proxy

What made me develop this program?
That's just because I wanted to be able to access Google and some other websites which are blocked in China. 
While a friend of mine told me a HTTP proxy (IP + port) on the Internet, I couldn't use it from my office computer 
because my office computer (and all my colleagues' computers) had to connect to a HTTP proxy provided by my company first to 
connect to the Internet. It seemed that I needed to specify TWO proxies in Internet Options of my browser. But that was impossible,
which made me decide to write this Java program.
