# how to enable your browser to use two-level http proxies

What made me develop this program?
That's just because I wanted to be able to access Google and some other websites which are blocked in China. 
While a friend of mine told me a HTTP proxy (IP + port) on the Internet, I couldn't use it from my office computer 
because my office computer (and all my colleagues' computers) had to connect to an HTTP proxy provided by my company first to 
connect to the Internet. It seemed that I needed to specify TWO proxies in Internet Options of my browser. But that was impossible,
which made me decide to write this Java program.
